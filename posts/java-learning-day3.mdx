## Recap of Previous Lecture

In the previous lecture, we covered some fundamental concepts in Java programming, including variables, arithmetic operators, and increment and decrement operators. We discussed how to declare variables in Java, assign values to them, and perform arithmetic operations using basic arithmetic operators. We also learned about the increment and decrement operators ++ and --, and their various placements and effects on the value of a variable.


## What We Will Learn Today

In today's lecture, we will continue to build on these fundamentals and explore some new concepts. Specifically, we will focus on boolean and comparison operators, if statements, and the true and false behaviors in Java.

We will start by learning about boolean variables, which are used to represent true or false values in Java. We will discuss how to declare boolean variables, assign values to them, and use them in conditional statements.

Next, we will explore comparison operators, including &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==, and !=. We will learn how to use these operators to compare values and create conditional statements based on the results of the comparisons.

We will then move on to if statements, which are used to control the flow of our code based on certain conditions. We will learn how to use if statements to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

Finally, we will discuss the true and false behaviors in Java, including the truth tables for the logical operators && and ||. We will learn how to use these operators to combine multiple conditions in a single statement, and how to create more complex conditional statements.

By the end of this lecture, you will have a better understanding of how to control the flow of your code based on conditions, and how to use boolean variables and operators to write more complex programs.

## Introduction

In this blog, we will continue to build on the fundamentals of Java programming and explore new concepts. Specifically, we will focus on boolean variables, comparison operators, and if statements. We will learn how to use these concepts to control the flow of our code based on conditions and create more complex programs.

## Boolean Variables

Boolean variables are used to represent true or false values in Java. To declare a boolean variable, you use the following syntax:

```java
boolean isTrue;
```

To assign a value to a boolean variable, you use the assignment operator (=) with either the true or false keyword. For example, to assign the value true to the variable isTrue, you would use the following code:

```java
isTrue = true;
```

You can also declare and assign a value to a boolean variable in a single statement, like this:

```java
boolean isFalse = false;
```

Boolean variables are often used in conditional statements, which we will discuss in the next section.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators allow you to compare the values of two variables. The comparison operators in Java are:

* &lt;: less than
* &gt;: greater than
* &lt;=: less than or equal to
* &gt;=: greater than or equal to
* ==: equal to
* !=: not equal to

For example, to check if the value of x is greater than the value of y, you would use the following code:

```java
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
}
```

To check if the value of x is equal to the value of y, you would use the following code:

```java
if (x == y) {
    System.out.println("x is equal to y");
}
```

You can also use comparison operators to create more complex conditional statements by combining multiple conditions with logical operators, which we will discuss in the next section.

### if statements

If statements are used to control the flow of our code based on certain conditions. An if statement has the following syntax:

```code
//Example 1
if (<condition>) {
    <code block>
}

//Example 2
if (<condition>) {
    <code block 1>
} else {
    <code block 2>
}

//Example 3
if (<condition 1>) {
    <code block 1>
} else if (<condition 2>) {
    <code block 2>
} else {
    <code block 3>
}
```

For example 1, If the condition is true, the code block will be executed. If the condition is false, the code block will be skipped. For example, to check if the value of x is greater than the value of y and print a message to the console if it is, you would use the following code:

```java
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
}
```

You can also use else statements to execute a different block of code if the condition is false. An if-else statement has the following syntax:

for example 2, If the condition is true, code block 1 will be executed. If the condition is false, code block 2 will be executed. For example, to check if the value of x is greater than the value of y and print a different message to the console if it is not, you would use the following code:

```java
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is not greater than y");
}
```

You can also use else if statements to test multiple conditions in a single if-else statement.

For example 3, If condition 1 is true, code block 1 will be executed. If condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true, code block 2 will be executed. If both condition 1 and condition 2 are false, code block 3 will be executed. For example, to check if the value of x is greater than the value of y, equal to the value of y, or less than the value of y, you would use the following code:

```java
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
} else if (x == y) {
    System.out.println("x is equal to y");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is less than y");
}
```

## True and False Behaviors in Java

In Java, the true and false keywords are used to represent true and false values, respectively. These values can be combined using logical operators to create more complex conditions.

The logical operators in Java are:

* &&: logical AND
* ||: logical OR

Boolean expressions are a fundamental part of Java programming, as they allow us to represent and evaluate conditions that can be either true or false. In Java, we can use the && and || operators to combine boolean expressions and evaluate them based on their truth values.

The && operator is used to evaluate a boolean expression as true only if both operands are true. If either operand is false, the entire expression is evaluated as false. For example, true && false evaluates to false, since one operand is false.

The || operator is used to evaluate a boolean expression as true if at least one operand is true. If both operands are false, the entire expression is evaluated as false. For example, true || false evaluates to true, since one operand is true.

Here are all possible examples of boolean expressions using the && and || operators:

* **true && true**: This expression evaluates to true, since both operands are true.
* **true && false**: This expression evaluates to false, since one operand is false.
* **false && true**: This expression evaluates to false, since one operand is false.
* **false && false**: This expression evaluates to false, since both operands are false.
* **true || true**: This expression evaluates to true, since at least one operand is true.
* **true || false**: This expression evaluates to true, since one operand is true.
* **false || true**: This expression evaluates to true, since one operand is true.
* **false || false**: This expression evaluates to false, since both operands are false.

It's important to remember that the && and || operators are used to combine boolean expressions and evaluate them based on their truth values. These operators are commonly used in conditional statements to determine the flow of a program based on the values of certain conditions.

Let's look at some examples

```java
// Example 1: Using && operator
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
if (x > 0 && y > 0) {
    System.out.println("Both x and y are positive.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Either x or y is not positive.");
}

// Example 2: Using || operator
int age = 25;
if (age < 18 || age >= 65) {
    System.out.println("You qualify for a discount.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You do not qualify for a discount.");
}

// Example 3: Combining && and || operators
boolean isWeekday = true;
int hour = 12;
if ((isWeekday && hour >= 9 && hour < 17) || (!isWeekday && hour >= 10 && hour < 16)) {
    System.out.println("The office is open.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The office is closed.");
}
```

Above example will output

```code
Both x and y are positive.
You do not qualify for a discount.
The office is open.
```

In the first example, we use the && operator to check if both variables x and y are positive. If both are positive, we print a message to the console. Otherwise, we print a different message.

In the second example, we use the || operator to check if the age variable is either less than 18 or greater than or equal to 65. If the condition is true, we print a message to the console indicating that the person qualifies for a discount.

In the third example, we use both && and || operators to check if the office is open. We check if it is a weekday and if the hour is between 9am and 5pm. If it is not a weekday, we check if the hour is between 10am and 4pm. If the condition is true, we print a message to the console indicating that the office is open. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that it is closed.

These examples demonstrate how the && and || operators can be used to combine boolean expressions and evaluate them based on their truth values.


## What We Will Learn Next

In today's lecture, we learned about boolean variables, comparison operators, if statements, and the true and false behaviors in Java. We learned how to use boolean variables to represent true or false values, use comparison operators to compare the values of variables, and use if statements to control the flow of our code based on certain conditions. We also explored the true and false behaviors in Java, including the truth tables for the logical operators && and ||.

In the next lecture, we will continue to build on these fundamentals and explore some new concepts related to control flow in Java. Specifically, we will focus on loops, which allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly based on certain conditions. We will learn about the three main types of loops in Java: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. We will discuss how to set loop conditions, declare loop variables, perform actions within the loop, and avoid common mistakes. By the end of the lecture, you will have a better understanding of how to use loops to control the flow of your code and execute a block of code repeatedly based on certain conditions.
