In this tutorial, we will cover the steps to deploy a Node.js application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Process Manager 2 (PM2), Nginx, Load Balancers, and other tools.

## Create instance in EC2

To get started, access the EC2 instance from your Mac Terminal using the following commands:

**Access EC2 Instance from Mac Terminal**

1. Change the permission of your EC2 key file to read-only: chmod 400 your-key.pem.
2. SSH into your instance using your key file: ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xx.region.compute.amazonaws.com.

## Installing Node/NPM

After logging into the EC2 instance, update and upgrade the installed packages using the following commands:

1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt upgrade

Next, install curl using the following command: sudo apt install -y curl.

Then, install Node.js version 16 by running the following commands:

1. curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
2. sudo apt install -y nodejs

You can verify that Node.js has been installed by running node --version.

At this point, you should be all set.
Just to be certain, you can run node to figure out what version you’re currently running:

`node  --version` - this will output **v16.x.x**

## Cloning your project from Github

Now that the dependencies and packages are installed, clone your Node.js project from GitHub directly to your Ubuntu server. Here are the steps:

1. You ened to Generate a new SSH key.

- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@gmail.com`
  use your email that is linked with GitHub Account

2. Adding your SSH key to ssh-agent

- `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

3. Add your key to GitHub

- `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` - copy your key
- go to Github.com
- Settings -> Account Settings -> SSH and GPG Keys -> new SSH Key
- paste your key

4. You can store your git configuration to prevent the system from asking passphrase everytime

- `git config --global credential.helper store`

## Installing dependencies from Node.js Proejct

1.  Go to your folder containing package.json and run - `npm install`

## Setting up PM2 Process Manager

**Why use Pm2?**

> PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.

**Install PM2 using NPM**

`sudo npm i pm2 -g`

## Setting up NGINX

Assuming that you are using this EC2 instance for a single Node.js/MERN app and not multiple apps, install Nginx using the following command: `sudo apt install nginx`.
Edit the default configuration file by navigating to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and then running `sudo vim default`. Modify the following section:

```vim
server_name _;
location / {
# First attempt to serve request as file, then
# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

Add the following snippet replacing the section in the default config

```vim
server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; #your api domain
location / {
proxy_pass http://localhost:8000
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```
Restart Nginx using sudo service nginx restart, and then check its status using sudo systemctl status nginx.

- Output

```sh
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok

nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is
successful
```

```sh
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server

Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

Active: active (running) since DAY YYYY-MM-DD HH:M:SS UTC; X days ago

Docs: man:nginx(8)

Main PID: xxxx (nginx)

Tasks: 2 (limit: 1160)

Memory: X M

CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service

├─ xxxx nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;

└─xxxx nginx: worker process
```
## Creating an SSL Certificate and Load Balancer
To issue an SSL certificate, create a load balancer, and map your instance to the load balancer, follow the steps below:

1. Issue an SSL Certificate (Certificate Manager)
* Choose the domain name you want to secure.
* Click on "Request a certificate".
* Add the domain name and validate it.
* Once the validation is completed, you can download the SSL certificate.
2. Create Load Balancer
* Choose "Application Load Balancer".
* Give it a name and select "Internet-facing" scheme.
* Choose the IP address type as "IPv4".
* Choose the VPC you created earlier.
* Select two availability zones.
* Add two listeners, one for HTTP (port 80) and one for HTTPS (port 443).
* Select the SSL certificate you just created from the certificate manager.
* Create a target group and attach the instances you created earlier.
* Configure the load balancer security group to allow traffic on ports 80 and 443.
* Save the changes.
3. Add a Record to the Load Balancer in Route 53
* Choose the domain name you want to add a record to.
* Click on "Create Record".
* Choose "A" record type.
* Choose "Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer".
* Choose the region your load balancer is in.
* Select the load balancer you just created.
* Create the record.
4. Add Rules to Load Balancer
* Add a rule for HTTPS (port 443).
* Add a rule for HTTP (port 80).

With these steps, you have successfully created an SSL certificate, load balancer, and attached your instance to it. You can now access your Node.js app securely through HTTPS on port 443.
