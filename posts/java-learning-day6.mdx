## Recap of Previous Lecture

In our last lecture, we focused on methods and classes in Java. We explored how to create and use methods, including defining them with the correct syntax, specifying parameters, and returning values. We also discussed method overloading and the importance of the 'this' keyword.

Furthermore, we delved into classes, discussing how they act as blueprints for creating objects. We covered the basics of object-oriented programming, including constructors, object instances, and the use of inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes. We also touched upon the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

## What We Will Learn Today

In today's lecture, we will continue to expand our Java programming knowledge by focusing on the following topics:

1. Abstract classes and methods
2. Interfaces
3. Nested classes
4. Generics
5. Lambda expressions
6. Reflection
7. Annotations

These advanced Java concepts will enable you to write more complex and flexible programs, enhancing your programming expertise in this versatile language.

## Introduction
