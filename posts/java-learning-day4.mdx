## Recap of Previous Lecture

In the previous lecture, we covered some fundamental concepts in Java programming, including variables, arithmetic operators, and increment and decrement operators. We discussed how to declare variables in Java, assign values to them, and perform arithmetic operations using basic arithmetic operators. We also learned about the increment and decrement operators ++ and --, and their various placements and effects on the value of a variable.


## What We Will Learn Today

In today's lecture, we will continue to build on these fundamentals and explore some new concepts. Specifically, we will focus on boolean and comparison operators, if statements, and the true and false behaviors in Java.

We will start by learning about boolean variables, which are used to represent true or false values in Java. We will discuss how to declare boolean variables, assign values to them, and use them in conditional statements.

Next, we will explore comparison operators, including &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==, and !=. We will learn how to use these operators to compare values and create conditional statements based on the results of the comparisons.

We will then move on to if statements, which are used to control the flow of our code based on certain conditions. We will learn how to use if statements to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

Finally, we will discuss the true and false behaviors in Java, including the truth tables for the logical operators && and ||. We will learn how to use these operators to combine multiple conditions in a single statement, and how to create more complex conditional statements.

By the end of this lecture, you will have a better understanding of how to control the flow of your code based on conditions, and how to use boolean variables and operators to write more complex programs.

## Introduction

Loops are an essential part of programming, and they allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly based on certain conditions. In Java, there are three main types of loops: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. In this lecture, we will discuss each of these loops in detail, along with some best practices and common mistakes to avoid when using loops in Java.

## Scanner

Before we dive into loops, we will look at Java Scanner. In Java, the Scanner class is used to read input from various sources, such as the console or a file. It is a very powerful tool for processing user input and creating interactive programs. The Scanner class is located in the java.util package, so you will need to import it at the beginning of your program like this:

```code
import java.util.Scanner;
```

Once you have imported the Scanner class, you can create a Scanner object and use it to read input from the user. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
    String name = scanner.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a Scanner object called scanner and use it to read input from the user. The System.in argument tells the Scanner to read input from the console. We then prompt the user to enter their name using the System.out.print() method, and read their input using the scanner.nextLine() method. Finally, we use the input to print a personalized message to the console.

The Scanner class provides many other methods for reading input, including nextInt(), nextDouble(), and nextBoolean(), which can be used to read different types of data from the user.

Here's an example that uses the nextInt() method to read an integer from the user and calculate its square:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
    int number = scanner.nextInt();
    int square = number * number;
    System.out.println("The square of " + number + " is " + square);
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the nextInt() method to read an integer from the user, store it in the number variable, calculate its square, and print the result to the console.

It's important to note that the Scanner class can throw exceptions if the input entered by the user is not in the expected format. For example, if you use the nextInt() method to read an integer and the user enters a non-numeric value, the program will throw an exception. You can use exception handling to gracefully handle these errors and prevent the program from crashing.

In summary, the Scanner class is a powerful tool for reading input from the user in Java. It provides many methods for reading different types of data, and can be used to create interactive programs and perform calculations based on user input.

## For Loop

The for loop is a type of loop in Java that is used to execute a block of code a fixed number of times. This is accomplished by setting up a loop variable, a loop condition, and an update statement. The loop variable is used to track the progress of the loop, the loop condition is used to determine when the loop should terminate, and the update statement is used to modify the loop variable at the end of each iteration.

The basic syntax of the for loop in Java is as follows:

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

The initialization statement is used to declare and initialize the loop variable. This is typically done using the assignment operator (=). For example:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

In this example, we are declaring a loop variable i of type int and initializing it to 0. The loop condition is i < 10, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as i is less than 10. The update statement is i++, which adds 1 to the value of i at the end of each iteration.

The code inside the for loop will be executed as long as the loop condition is true. Once the loop condition becomes false, the loop will terminate and execution will continue with the code following the loop.

One important thing to note is that the loop variable is only accessible within the for loop itself. Once the loop has finished executing, the loop variable is no longer in scope and cannot be accessed.

You can also use the for loop to iterate over arrays or other collections. For example:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

In this example, we are iterating over an array of integers called numbers. The loop condition is i < numbers.length, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as i is less than the length of the numbers array. The loop variable i is used to index into the array and print each element to the console.

There are many ways to use the for loop in Java, and it is an incredibly powerful tool for controlling the flow of your code and executing a block of code repeatedly. However, it is important to be careful when using the loop variable and to make sure the loop condition is properly set up to avoid infinite loops. With practice and experience, you will become proficient at using the for loop and be able to take advantage of its many features and capabilities.


## While Loop

The while loop is another type of loop in Java that is used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a certain condition. Unlike the for loop, which executes a fixed number of times, the while loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true.

The basic syntax of the while loop in Java is as follows:

```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

```

The code inside the while loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop will terminate and execution will continue with the code following the loop.

One important thing to note is that the condition must be a boolean expression. This means that it must evaluate to either true or false. If the condition is initially false, the code inside the while loop will never be executed.

You can also use the while loop to iterate over collections or perform other tasks. For example, to iterate over an array of integers called numbers, you could use the following code:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int i = 0;
while (i < numbers.length) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
    i++;
}
```

In this example, we are using a loop variable i to index into the numbers array and print each element to the console. The condition i < numbers.length ensures that the loop will terminate once we have printed all the elements in the array.

It is important to be careful when using the while loop to avoid infinite loops. If the condition inside the while loop is always true, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely and your program will hang.

Overall, the while loop is a powerful tool for controlling the flow of your code and executing a block of code repeatedly based on a certain condition. With practice and experience, you will become proficient at using the while loop and be able to take advantage of its many features and capabilities.

## Do-While Loop

The do-while loop is another type of loop in Java that is used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a certain condition. Unlike the for loop and while loop, the do-while loop guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once, even if the loop condition is false.

The basic syntax of the do-while loop in Java is as follows:

```java
do {
// code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

The code block inside the do-while loop will be executed first, and then the loop condition will be checked. If the condition is true, the code block will be executed again, and the process will repeat until the condition is false.

One important thing to note is that the code block inside the do-while loop must end with a semicolon (;), unlike the code block inside the for loop and while loop.

Here is an example of how to use the do-while loop to repeatedly ask the user for input until they enter a valid number:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter a number between 1 and 10: ");
            number = scanner.nextInt();
        } while (number < 1 || number > 10);

        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using the do-while loop to repeatedly ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. The loop condition is number < 1 || number > 10, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as the user enters a number outside of the specified range.

Once the user enters a valid number, the loop will terminate, and the program will print the number to the console.

Like the for loop and while loop, it is important to be careful when using the do-while loop to avoid infinite loops. However, the do-while loop can be a useful tool in situations where you need to guarantee that the code block will be executed at least once.

## Best Practices and Common Mistakes

When using loops in Java, it is important to follow some best practices to ensure that your code is efficient and maintainable. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

* Use the most appropriate loop for the task at hand
* Be careful with infinite loops
* Declare variables outside the loop if possible to improve performance
* Use meaningful variable names to improve readability
* Avoid modifying loop variables inside the loop condition

### Common mistakes to avoid when using loops in Java include:

* Not initializing loop variables
* Not updating loop variables correctly
* Using the wrong comparison operator in the loop condition
* Forgetting to include the increment/decrement statement in the for loop
* Using an incorrect syntax for the do-while loop

## What We Will Learn Next

In today's lecture, we learned about two important concepts in Java programming: loops and the Scanner class. We explored the three main types of loops in Java: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. We discussed how to set loop conditions, declare loop variables, and perform actions within the loop. We also highlighted some best practices and common mistakes to avoid when using loops in Java.

In addition to loops, we learned about the Scanner class, which is used to read user input from the console. We discussed how to create a Scanner object and use it to read various types of user input, including integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.

In the next lecture, we will continue to build on these fundamentals and explore some new concepts related to Java programming. Specifically, we will focus on arrays, methods, and classes in Java. We will discuss how to declare and use arrays to store multiple values of the same type. We will also explore how to define and call methods in Java, and how to create and use classes to organize our code and create objects. By the end of the lecture, you will have a better understanding of these concepts and be able to use them to write more complex programs in Java.
