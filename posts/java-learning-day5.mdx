## Recap of Previous Lecture

In the previous lecture, we learned about loops in Java, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop. We discussed how to set loop conditions, declare loop variables, perform actions within the loop, and avoid common mistakes.

## What We Will Learn Today

In today's lecture, we will continue to build on these fundamentals and explore some new concepts related to Java programming. Specifically, we will focus on arrays, methods, and classes.

We will start by learning about arrays, which are used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable. We will discuss how to declare and initialize arrays, access individual elements, and perform operations on array elements.

Next, we will explore methods, which are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called from other parts of the program. We will learn how to define and call methods, pass arguments to methods, and return values from methods.

Finally, we will discuss classes, which are templates for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. We will learn how to define classes, create objects from classes, and access object properties and methods.

By the end of this lecture, you will have a better understanding of how to use arrays, methods, and classes in Java to create more complex and powerful programs.

## Introduction

Welcome to today's lecture on Java programming! In this lecture, we will dive deeper into some of the core concepts and features of Java, including arrays, methods, and classes. These topics are essential for building more complex and powerful programs in Java, and will help you become a more skilled and versatile Java programmer. So, let's get started!
