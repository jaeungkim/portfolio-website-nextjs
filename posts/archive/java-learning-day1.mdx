## What is Java ?

Java is a programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s.
It was designed to be simple, object-oriented, and platform-independent.
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for developing mobile applications, web applications, and desktop applications.
It is a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used for a wide range of applications.

Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, which means that Java programs can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes Java a platform-independent language, which is one of the reasons why it has become so popular.

## How does Java work ?

Java code is written in a text editor and saved with a .java extension. The code is then compiled into bytecode, which can be executed by the JVM. The JVM is a virtual machine that is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing the Java program.

Java is also an object-oriented programming language, which means that it uses objects and classes to represent data and behavior. Objects are instances of classes, which are templates for creating objects. Classes can contain data (in the form of variables) and behavior (in the form of methods).

## Why is Java Important ?

Java is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in the technology industry. It is used for developing mobile applications, web applications, and enterprise-scale systems, among other things. Some of the key features of Java include:

* Platform-independence: Java programs can run on any system that has a JVM installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.
* Object-oriented programming: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it uses objects and classes to represent data and behavior.
* Large and active developer community: Java has a large and active developer community, with a wide range of tools, libraries, and frameworks available to help developers build and deploy Java applications.
* Security: Java has built-in security features, such as the SecurityManager class, that help to protect against malicious code.

## Java Data Structures

Java provides a wide range of data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data. Some of the most commonly used data structures in Java include:

* Arrays: Arrays are a basic data structure that allow you to store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
* Lists: Lists are a dynamic data structure that allow you to store a variable-size collection of elements of the same type. Some common types of lists in Java include ArrayList and LinkedList.
* Sets: Sets are a data structure that allow you to store a collection of unique elements. Some common types of sets in Java include HashSet and TreeSet.
* Maps: Maps are a data structure that allow you to store a collection of key-value pairs. Some common types of maps in Java include HashMap and TreeMap.

## OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) with Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it uses objects and classes to represent data and behavior. There are several key principles of OOP that are used in Java, including:

* **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world. It is achieved by defining the object's public interface, which is the set of methods and properties that can be accessed from outside the object. Encapsulation helps to ensure that the object's internal state remains consistent and prevents unauthorized access to the object's data.
* **Inheritance**: Inheritance is the practice of creating new classes by extending existing classes. This allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes. Inheritance helps to reduce code duplication and makes it easier to maintain and modify code over time.
* **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. This is done by defining a common interface for a group of related classes. Polymorphism helps to make code more flexible and reusable.
* **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the practice of focusing on essential features of an object and ignoring the details that are not relevant to the current task. This is done by defining abstract classes or interfaces that provide a high-level view of an object's behavior, without specifying the details of how that behavior is implemented. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity and improve the clarity and maintainability of code.

![Four Pillars of Java OOP](/images/java-pillars.jpeg)

These are also known as the four pillars of Java OOP. Together, these four pillars of Java OOP provide a powerful set of tools for designing and developing complex software systems. By using these principles, developers can create code that is flexible, reusable, and easy to maintain over time.

## Examples of Java Pillars

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world. This is achieved by using access modifiers to control access to the object's fields and methods.

Here's an example of encapsulation in action:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a Person class with private fields name and age. We also define public getter and setter methods for these fields, allowing us to control access to the object's internal state. By making the fields private, we prevent other code from directly modifying the object's state, ensuring that it remains consistent and preventing unauthorized access.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is the practice of creating new classes by extending existing classes. This allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes.

Here's an example of inheritance in action:

```java
public class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The animal is eating.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog is barking.");
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public void meow() {
        System.out.println("The cat is meowing.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we define an Animal class with a eat() method. We then define two subclasses, Dog and Cat, which extend the Animal class and add their own unique behaviors (bark() and meow(), respectively). By using inheritance, we can reuse the Animal class's behavior in the Dog and Cat classes, saving us from duplicating code.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. This is achieved by using interfaces or inheritance to define a common set of methods that can be used with objects of different types.

Here's an example of polymorphism in action:

```java
public interface Shape {
    public double area();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a Shape interface with a area() method. We then define two classes, Circle and Rectangle, which implement the Shape interface and provide their own implementations of the area() method. We can then use polymorphism to treat objects of type Circle and Rectangle as if they were of type Shape, allowing us to write code that is more flexible and reusable.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the practice of focusing on essential features of an object and ignoring the details that are not relevant to the current task. This is achieved by using abstract classes or interfaces

Here's an example of abstraction in action:

```java
public abstract class Vehicle {
    public abstract void start();
    public abstract void stop();
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("The car is stopping.");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("The motorcycle is starting.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("The motorcycle is stopping.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we define an abstract class Vehicle with abstract methods start() and stop(). We then define two concrete subclasses, Car and Motorcycle, which extend the Vehicle class and provide their own implementations of the start() and stop() methods. By using abstraction, we can focus on the essential features of a Vehicle (i.e., its ability to start and stop) without worrying about the specific details of each type of Vehicle.

In summary, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction are the four pillars of Java OOP. By understanding and applying these concepts, you can create well-structured, modular, and reusable code that is easier to understand and maintain.
