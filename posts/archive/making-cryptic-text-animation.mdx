## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will build a cryptic animation effect using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The animation will take a given text string and gradually reveal it by replacing random characters with the actual letters from the text.

## Step 1. Setting up your project.

First, we need to set up a new Next.js project. If you already have one, you can skip this step.

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

Follow the prompts and create your new project.

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

In this project, we will need to install clsx, a tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.

Install it by running:

```bash
npm install clsx
```

## Step 3: Create a New Component

Create a new TypeScript file in your components folder and name it CrypticText.tsx. This is where we will implement our cryptic animation effect.

In this component, we have three props:

* text - The text to be animated.
* classNames - Optional class names for styling.
* delay - An optional delay before the animation starts.

```tsx
type CrypticTextDynamicProps = {
  text: string;
  classNames?: string;
  delay?: number;
};

export default function CrypticText({
  text,
  classNames,
  delay,
}: CrypticTextDynamicProps) {
}
```

## Step 4: Define the Animation Logic

Inside the CrypticText function, define the initial state for cryptic variable:

```tsx
const [cryptic, setCryptic] = useState("");
```

Then, define the animate function, which is wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Inside this function, we will create the animation logic:

```tsx
const animate = useCallback(() => {
  // The set of characters used in the animation
  const letters = "ガギグゲゴザジズゼゾダヂヅデドバビブベボパピプペポ"; //or any of what you want to display in animation

  // Repeat divider and timeout value for the animation
  const repeatDivider = 4;
  const timeoutValue = 0.1 + (delay ? delay : 0) * 60;

  // Variables for the animation
  let iteration = 0;
  let elapsed = 0;
  let animation: number;

  // Animation callback function
  function animateCallback() {
    // The rest of the animation logic goes here...
  }

  animateCallback();

  return () => cancelAnimationFrame(animation);
}, [delay, text]);
```

Inside animateCallback, we will gradually replace each character in the text string with a random letter from the letters string until the original text is completely revealed.

## Step 5: Start the Animation

Use the useEffect hook to call the animate function when the component is mounted:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  animate();
}, [animate]);
```

## Step 6: Render the Component

Finally, render the text with the applied animation and additional styles:

```tsx
return (
  <span
    className={clsx("text-inherit whitespace-normal truncate block relative", classNames)}
    style={{
        animationDelay: `${delay + 0.1}s)`,
    }}
  >
    <span className="absolute inset-0">{cryptic}</span>
    <span className="opacity-0">{text}</span>
  </span>
);
```

That's it! You have created a cryptic animation with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This component can be used anywhere in your application, just remember to pass in a text prop and optional classNames and delay props.

Remember, this animation effect will work best on large, bold texts, and might not look as good on smaller or thinner texts. The appearance can be adjusted by changing the set of letters used in the animation. Experiment with different options to see what looks best in your project.

Happy coding!
