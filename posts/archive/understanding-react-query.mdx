### Introduction

As you embark on your journey with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, you'll soon encounter the challenges of managing server state. React is exceptional at handling UI state, but when it comes to dealing with asynchronous data fetching, updates, and synchronization with the server state, things can get complex. This is where `React Query`, a robust library in the React ecosystem, comes to the rescue. It's designed to simplify the process of fetching, caching, and updating data in your React applications.
`React Query` stands out as a powerhouse for server-state management. It enables developers to write less code, avoid boilerplate, and eliminate a significant amount of complexity that comes with managing server state in traditional React applications.

### What is React Query?

React Query is not just another state management library. Instead, it focuses specifically on server state management, which is crucial for any modern web application interacting with a backend. Server state is inherently asynchronous and external to your application, making it different from the UI state that libraries like Redux or Context API typically manage.

React Query provides tools and functionalities to efficiently handle data fetching (GET requests), data mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE requests), and data synchronization between server and client. It does this while offering features like background fetching, caching, automatic refetching, and more.

### Why React Query?

- **Simplified Data Fetching:** Traditional data fetching involves handling **loading states, errors, and updating the UI** upon data arrival. React Query encapsulates these patterns, reducing the need for boilerplate code.
- **Automatic Caching and Synchronization:** It automatically **caches your data** and provides easy ways to synchronize the cache with your UI, ensuring that your **user interface always reflects the most current server state**.
- **Optimized Performance:** By reducing the number of requests to the server through intelligent caching and background refetching, React Query **improves the performance** of your application.
- **Built-in Error Handling:** It has robust error handling mechanisms, saving you from writing repetitive **try-catch blocks** or error state management logic.
- **DevTools:** React Query comes with powerful **DevTools**, making it easier to inspect and debug queries and mutations.

### Understanding `useQuery`

`useQuery` is primarily used for data fetching and is part of React Query’s arsenal for managing asynchronous data from APIs. The hook automates fetching, refetching, caching, and updating the UI based on the data's status (loading, success, error).

#### Basic Structure

The basic structure of `useQuery` includes:

1. **`queryKey`**: A unique key for the query, which React Query uses for caching and tracking the query’s state.
2. **`queryFn`**: A function that returns the data. This is where you call your API.
3. **`options`**: An optional configuration object for fine-tuning the query's behavior.

#### Basic Usage Example

Suppose you want to fetch a list of todos from an API.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

const fetchTodos = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/todos');
  return response.json();
};

function TodoList() {
  const { data, isLoading, isError, error } = useQuery('todos', fetchTodos);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (isError) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- `useQuery` fetches todo items using `fetchTodos`.
- The query has a key `'todos'` for caching and retrieval.
- It automatically manages the loading and error states.

#### Advanced Usage: Dynamic Query Keys

Dynamic query keys enable you to fetch data based on variables, like fetching a specific item by its ID.

```tsx
const fetchTodo = async (todoId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/todos/${todoId}`);
  return response.json();
};

function TodoItem({ todoId }) {
  const { data, isLoading, isError, error } = useQuery(['todo', todoId], () => fetchTodo(todoId));

  // rendering logic...
}
```

Here, the query key is an array: `['todo', todoId]`. React Query treats each unique `todoId` as a separate cached query.

#### Handling Dependent Queries

Sometimes you need to run queries based on the outcome of another. `useQuery` allows for dependent queries using the `enabled` option.

```tsx
function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const { data: user } = useQuery(['user', userId], fetchUser);

  const { data: userPosts, isLoading } = useQuery(
    ['posts', user?.id],
    () => fetchUserPosts(user.id),
    { enabled: !!user?.id }
  );

  // rendering logic...
}
```

#### Scenario: Fetching User Data with Search and Pagination

Imagine you have an application where you need to fetch user data from an API based on search criteria and pagination. You want to cache these results, refetch data when the window is refocused, and also manage the stale time for the cache.

#### Step 1: Define the Fetch Function

```tsx
const fetchUsers = async ({ queryKey }) => {
  const [_key, { search, page }] = queryKey;
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users?search=${search}&page=${page}`);
  return response.json();
};
```

In `fetchUsers`, we destructure the `queryKey` to access the search term and page number. The API endpoint is then called with these parameters.

#### Step 2: Use the useQuery Hook with Options

```tsx
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

function UsersList({ search, page }) {
  const result = useQuery(
    ['users', { search, page }],
    fetchUsers,
    {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // data is fresh for 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 30 * 60 * 1000, // cache the data for 30 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true, // refetch data when the window is refocused
      keepPreviousData: true, // keep previous data while new data is being fetched
      onError: (error) => {
        // handle error
      },
      onSuccess: (data) => {
        // handle success
      }
    }
  );

  // rendering logic...
}
```

In this example:

- `queryKey` is an array with a base key `'users'` and an object containing the `search` term and `page` number.
- The `fetchUsers` function is passed as `queryFn`.
- `staleTime` and `cacheTime` control the caching behavior.
- `refetchOnWindowFocus` ensures data is fresh.
- `keepPreviousData` is particularly useful for pagination, allowing users to see the old data while the new page's data is loading.
- `onError` and `onSuccess` are callbacks for error handling and post-fetch actions, respectively.

## Understanding `useMutation`

#### Basic Structure

The fundamental components of `useMutation` include:

1. **`mutationFn`**: This is the function that performs the mutation (such as POST, PUT, DELETE requests to an API).
2. **`options`**: An optional configuration object that allows you to define callbacks like `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onMutate`.

#### Basic Usage Example

Suppose you have a form for adding new todos:

```tsx
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';

const addTodo = async (newTodo) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/todos', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
  return response.json();
};

function TodoForm() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const { mutate } = useMutation(addTodo, {
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate and refetch
      queryClient.invalidateQueries('todos');
    },
  });

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const newTodo = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    mutate(newTodo);
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> {/* form fields here */} </form>;
}

```

In this example:

- `useMutation` is used to handle the creation of a new todo.
- After the new todo is added successfully, the `onSuccess` option invalidates the `todos` query, triggering a refetch to update the list with the new item.

#### Advanced Usage: Optimistic Updates

Optimistic updates provide a smoother user experience by updating the UI before the mutation is confirmed by the server.

```tsx
function TodoForm() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const { mutate } = useMutation(addTodo, {
    onMutate: async (newTodo) => {
      // Snapshot the previous value
      const previousTodos = queryClient.getQueryData('todos');

      // Optimistically update to the new value
      queryClient.setQueryData('todos', (old) => [...old, newTodo]);

      // Return a context with the previous and new todo
      return { previousTodos, newTodo };
    },
    onError: (error, newTodo, context) => {
      // Rollback to the previous value
      queryClient.setQueryData('todos', context.previousTodos);
    },
    onSettled: () => {
      // Invalidate and refetch
      queryClient.invalidateQueries('todos');
    },
  });

  // form handling logic...
}

```

Here, `onMutate` is used to apply the optimistic update. If the mutation fails, `onError` rolls back the changes using the snapshot from `onMutate`.

### Scenario: Updating User Profiles on a Social Media Platform

#### Background

Imagine you're developing a feature for a social media application that allows users to update their profile information, including their name, bio, and profile picture. The goal is to immediately reflect these changes in the UI for a smoother user experience, even before the server confirms the update (optimistic update). If the update fails, the UI should revert to the original state.

#### Step 1: Define the Mutation Function

```tsx
const updateUserProfile = async (userData) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/user/profile`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify(userData),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Profile update failed');
  }
  return response.json();
};
```

In `updateUserProfile`, we send a PUT request to update the user's profile.
#### Step 2: Use the useMutation Hook with Advanced Options

```tsx
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';

function UserProfileForm({ user }) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const { mutate, isLoading, isError, error } = useMutation(updateUserProfile, {
    onMutate: async (updatedUserData) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['userProfile', user.id]);

      const previousUserData = queryClient.getQueryData(['userProfile', user.id]);
      queryClient.setQueryData(['userProfile', user.id], { ...user, ...updatedUserData });

      return { previousUserData };
    },
    onError: (err, newUserData, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['userProfile', user.id], context.previousUserData);
    },
    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['userProfile', user.id]);
    },
  });

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const updatedUserData = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    mutate(updatedUserData);
  };

  // Form rendering logic...
}
```

In this example:

- `onMutate` performs an optimistic update by immediately reflecting the new user data in the UI.
- `onError` rolls back the UI to the previous user data if the update fails.
- `onSettled` is used to refetch the user profile data, ensuring the UI is in sync with the server state after the mutation, regardless of success or failure.
- The form uses `handleSubmit` to trigger the mutation when the user submits their updated profile information.

### Summary

This blog post provided a comprehensive exploration of two critical hooks in React Query: `useQuery` and `useMutation`. These tools are instrumental in efficiently managing server state in React applications, simplifying the processes of data fetching, caching, updating, and mutating.

With `useQuery`, we looked at how it automates the fetching and caching of data, handling the various states like loading, success, and error. We delved into its basic structure, comprising `queryKey`, `queryFn`, and `options`. Through examples, we illustrated its usage in fetching a list of items, handling dynamic queries with variable query keys, and managing dependent queries.

`useMutation` was examined as the tool for handling data mutations (create, update, delete operations). We explored its structure, including `mutationFn` and options for managing side effects. Practical examples demonstrated its application in tasks like adding new items and implementing optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback.

The scenarios presented — fetching user data with search and pagination, and updating user profiles on a social media platform — showcased the real-world applicability of `useQuery` and `useMutation`. These examples highlighted the hooks' capabilities in managing complex operations like dynamic queries, pagination, optimistic updates, and error handling.

### Conclusion

React Query emerges as a powerful and essential library for modern React developers. `useQuery` and `useMutation` significantly reduce the complexity and amount of code required to interact with server state. By abstracting the intricacies of data fetching and mutation, React Query allows developers to focus more on building a rich user interface and less on the underlying data management logic.

The seamless integration of these tools into React applications paves the way for more efficient, robust, and maintainable codebases. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding and leveraging the power of React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` can elevate your React applications to new levels of performance and user experience.
