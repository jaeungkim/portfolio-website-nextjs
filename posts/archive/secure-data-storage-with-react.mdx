### Introduction

Securing user data is a critical concern in web development. As React developers, we constantly seek efficient and secure ways to handle sensitive information. Enter `react-secure-storage`: a streamlined solution for data encryption and decryption in React. This post guides you through creating custom hooks, `useSecureStore` and `useSecureRetrieve`, simplifying data security in your React applications. Ready to elevate your app's data security? Let's dive in!

1. useSecureStore

The `useSecureStore` hook is responsible for securely storing data. It takes a `key` and `data` as arguments. The data is stored securely when the component mounts or when the data changes.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import secureStorage from "react-secure-storage";
export function useSecureStore(key, data) {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function storeData() {
      try {
        await secureStorage.setItem(key, data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error storing secure data:", error);
      }
    }
    if (data !== undefined) {
      storeData();
    }
  }, [key, data]);
}
```

### 2. useSecureRetrieve

The `useSecureRetrieve` hook is for retrieving data securely. It accepts a `key` and a `setData` function, which is used to update your component's state with the retrieved data.

```tsx
export function useSecureRetrieve(key, setData) {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function retrieveData() {
      try {
        const retrievedData = await secureStorage.getItem(key);
        if (retrievedData !== null) {
          setData(retrievedData);
        } else {
          console.log(`No data found for key: ${key}`);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error retrieving secure data:", error);
      }
    }
    retrieveData();
  }, [key, setData]);
}
```

## Using the Hooks in Components

Now let's see how we can use these hooks in our components to store and retrieve data.

### Storing Data

Imagine you have a user profile component, and you want to store the user's information securely.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useSecureStore } from "./hooks/useSecureStorage";

const UserProfile = () => {
  const userInfo = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  };

  useSecureStore("userInfo", userInfo);

  return <div>{/* Render your user profile UI */}</div>;
};

export default UserProfile;
```

### Retrieving Data

Now, if you want to retrieve and display this information in another component, you can use the useSecureRetrieve hook.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useSecureRetrieve } from "./hooks/useSecureStorage";

const DisplayProfile = () => {
  const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState(null);

  useSecureRetrieve("userInfo", setUserInfo);

  return (
    <div>
      {userInfo && (
        <div>
          <p>Name: {userInfo.name}</p>
          <p>Email: {userInfo.email}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DisplayProfile;
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging `react-secure-storage` and custom hooks, we've simplified the process of securely storing and retrieving data in React applications. This approach not only enhances the security of your application but also makes your code cleaner and more maintainable. Whether you're building a large-scale application or a small project, these practices will help you manage your secure data more effectively. Remember, the safety of user data is paramount, and with tools like `react-secure-storage`, you're taking a significant step in the right direction.
