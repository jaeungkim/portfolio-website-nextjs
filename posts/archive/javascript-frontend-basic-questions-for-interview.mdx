## Answers

<a id="answer1"></a>
### 1. Explain how Web Page gets displayed to end user step by step.
    - 1. URL Entry: The user enters a URL in the browser.
    - 2. DNS Lookup: The browser performs a DNS lookup to find the IP address of the server hosting the website.
    - 3. Browser Sends HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server at the resolved IP address.
    - 4. Server Responds: The server processes the request and sends back the requested HTML file along with associated resources like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
    - 5. Browser Parses HTML: The browser begins parsing the HTML document and converts elements into DOM (Document Object Model) nodes, forming a structure that represents the content of the page.
    - 6. CSS Parsing and CSSOM Creation: The browser parses CSS files and creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model), which contains style information.
    - 7. JavaScript Processing: If there's JavaScript, the browser executes it, which can modify the DOM and CSSOM.
    - 9. Render Tree Construction: The browser constructs the Render Tree from the DOM and CSSOM, which contains information about the content that needs to be rendered on the page.
    - 10. Layout Calculation: The browser calculates the layout of each visible element on the page.
    - 11. Painting: The browser paints the content on the screen, turning the Render Tree into pixels displayed to the user.
    - 12. JavaScript Modification (if applicable): JavaScript may run again to modify the page after it is initially rendered, leading to updates in the content.

### 2. Explain hoisting
    1. Variable Hoisting:
        * var Declarations: If you declare a variable using var, it is hoisted to the top of its functional or global scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. If you try to use the variable before the point where it is declared and initialized, it will have a value of undefined.

        ```tsx
        console.log(x); // undefined
        var x = 5;
        console.log(x); // 5
        ```

        * let and const Declarations: Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, but they remain in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is reached. Accessing them before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.

        ```tsx
        console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
        let y = 5;
        ```

    2. Function Hoisting:
        * Function Declarations: Function declarations are hoisted entirely to the top of their containing scope, meaning you can call a function before its declaration in the code.

        ```tsx
        hello(); // "Hello, world!"
        function hello() {
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        }
        ```

        * Function Expressions: Function expressions, on the other hand, are not hoisted. If a function is defined as part of an expression (including functions defined using const, let, or var), it won't be available until the execution reaches the point where the expression is defined.

        ```tsx
        hi(); // TypeError: hi is not a function
        var hi = function() {
            console.log("Hi!");
        };
        ```

### 3. What is Closure? Explain thoroughly with examples

A closure in JavaScript is a powerful and fundamental concept where a function retains access to its lexical scope even when that function is executed outside of its lexical scope. This behavior allows the function to remember and access variables from the scope in which it was declared, regardless of where it's being executed.

#### Understanding Lexical Scope

Before diving into closures, it's important to understand lexical scope. Lexical scope means that the accessibility of variables is determined by the physical location of the variables in the written code (i.e., their lexical environment). Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.

#### How Closures Work

A closure is created every time a function is defined. To see a closure in action, consider the following example:

```tsx
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am outside!';

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Access outerVariable
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

let myInnerFunction = outerFunction();
myInnerFunction(); // Logs: 'I am outside!'
```

In this example:

1. `outerFunction` creates a local variable `outerVariable` and an `innerFunction` that accesses `outerVariable`.
2. `outerFunction` then returns `innerFunction`.
3. Even after `outerFunction` has finished executing and its execution context is gone, `myInnerFunction` (which is `innerFunction`) still has access to `outerVariable`. This is a closure.

#### Why Closures Are Useful

Closures have several practical uses, such as:

1. **Data Encapsulation**: They allow for private variables and functions. Only the functions defined within the same scope as these "private" variables can access them.
2. **Creating Factory Functions**: You can create functions that generate other functions, each with their own private scope and variables.
3. **Event Handlers and Callbacks**: Closures are often used in event handlers and callbacks to maintain state and access data that was in scope when the handler or callback was created.

#### Example: Data Encapsulation

Here’s an example that demonstrates data encapsulation using closures:

```tsx
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return {
        increment: function() { count++; },
        decrement: function() { count--; },
        getCount: function() { return count; }
    };
}

let counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 2
counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
```

In this example, `count` is encapsulated within `createCounter`. The `counter` object can access and modify `count` via the `increment`, `decrement`, and `getCount` methods, but there's no way to directly access `count` from outside. This is a classic use of closures to encapsulate data.

#### Why Closures Matter

Closures are a fundamental aspect of functional programming in JavaScript and are essential for writing more secure and maintainable code. They allow for powerful patterns like modules and help in managing state in a controlled manner. Understanding closures is crucial for advanced JavaScript programming.

In summary closer is "when you have a function defined inside of another function, that inner function has access to the variables and scope of the outer function even if the outer function finishes executing and those variables are no longer accessible outside of that function."

### 48. Explain about types of Hooks in React

1. Built-in Hooks: The built-in Hooks are divided into 2 parts as given below:

* Basic Hooks
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useState()</mark>: This functional component is used to set and retrieve the state.
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useEffect()</mark>: It enables for performing the side effects in the functional components.
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useContext()</mark>: It is used for creating common data that is to be accessed by the components hierarchy without having to pass the props down to each level.
* Additional Hooks
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useReducer()</mark>: It is used when there is a complex state logic that is having several sub-values or when the upcoming state is dependent on the previous state. It will also enable you to optimization of component performance that will trigger deeper updates as it is permitted to pass the dispatch down instead of callbacks.
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useMemo()</mark>: This will be used for recomputing the memoized value when there is a change in one of the dependencies. This optimization will help for avoiding expensive calculations on each render.
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useCallback()</mark>: This is useful while passing callbacks into the optimized child components and depends on the equality of reference for the prevention of unneeded renders.
    * <mark style={{ backgroundColor: '#0ED7B5', padding: '4px', borderRadius: '10px' }}>useRef()</mark>: It will permit creating a reference to the DOM element directly within the functional component.

2. Custom Hooks: A custom Hook is basically a function of JavaScript. The Custom Hook working is similar to a regular function. The “use” at the beginning of the Custom Hook Name is required for React to understand that this is a custom Hook and also it will describe that this specific function follows the rules of Hooks. Moreover, developing custom Hooks will enable you for extracting component logic from within reusable functions.
