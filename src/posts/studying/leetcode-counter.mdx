Given an array of functions [f1, f2, f3, ..., fn], return a new function fn that is the function composition of the array of functions.

The function composition of [f(x), g(x), h(x)] is fn(x) = f(g(h(x))).

The function composition of an empty list of functions is the identity function f(x) = x.

You may assume each function in the array accepts one integer as input and returns one integer as output.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: functions = [x => x + 1, x => x * x, x => 2 * x], x = 4
Output: 65
Explanation:
Evaluating from right to left ...
Starting with x = 4.
2 * (4) = 8
(8) * (8) = 64
(64) + 1 = 65
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: functions = [x => 10 * x, x => 10 * x, x => 10 * x], x = 1
Output: 1000
Explanation:
Evaluating from right to left ...
10 * (1) = 10
10 * (10) = 100
10 * (100) = 1000
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: functions = [], x = 42
Output: 42
Explanation:
The composition of zero functions is the identity function
```

### APPROACH


To solve this problem, we'll implement a function compose that takes an array of unary (single-argument) functions and returns a new function that is the composition of those functions. The key concept here is function composition, a fundamental concept in functional programming where you combine functions to build up more complex operations.

The approach involves iterating over the array of functions in reverse order since function composition is right-associative; that is, you start applying the functions from the rightmost one to the left. Each function is called with the result of the previous function call.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Handle the Edge Case: If the input array is empty, we return the identity function, which returns its input unaltered. This is because the composition of no functions should not alter the input value.

2. Iterate Over Functions: If the array is not empty, we create and return a new function that closes over the functions array. When this new function is called with an input x, we perform the following steps:
* Initialize a variable result with x.
* Loop through the functions array in reverse order, applying each function to result and updating result with the return value.

3. Return the Final Result: After all functions have been applied, the final value of result is returned. This is the result of the composed function when applied to x.

By following this approach, we ensure that our compose function behaves according to the rules of function composition, applying each function in the correct order and handling cases where no functions are provided.

It's also worth noting that this approach is efficient because it involves just a single loop through the array and does not create any unnecessary intermediate arrays or function bindings, which could impact performance for a large number of functions.

### SOLUTION

```tsx
/**
 * @param {Function[]} functions
 * @return {Function}
 */
var compose = function(functions) {
  if (functions.length === 0) {
    return function(x) { return x; };
  }

  return function(x) {
    let result = x;
    for (let i = functions.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      result = functions[i](result);
    }
    return result;
  }
};

/**
 * const fn = compose([x => x + 1, x => 2 * x])
 * fn(4) // 9
 */
```
