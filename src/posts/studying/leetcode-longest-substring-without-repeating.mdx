Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```md
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```md
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```md
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### APPROACH

### SOLUTION

```java
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int a_pointer = 0;
        int b_pointer = 0;
        int max = 0;
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        //abcabcdd
        while(b_pointer < s.length()){
            if(!set.contains(s.charAt(b_pointer))){
                set.add(s.charAt(b_pointer));
                b_pointer++;
                max = Math.max(set.size(), max);
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(a_pointer));
                a_pointer++;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
```
