You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.

A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.

**Example 1:**

```md
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"
```

**Example 2:**

```md
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"
```

### APPROACH

The problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a target value is a classic programming challenge. In this solution, we use a brute-force approach that involves iterating through the array and comparing each pair of elements to see if their sum equals the target value. We accomplish this by using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each element in the array, while the inner loop iterates over the remaining elements to the right of the current element. If we find a pair of elements that add up to the target value, we return their indices. This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not the most efficient but works well for small arrays.

### SOLUTION

```java

```
