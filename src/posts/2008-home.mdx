### 2008.08 ~ Present

Vancouver is my home. I don't even remember the first day when I first came here.
Perhaps, Home is not always where you were born. Maybe sometimes, it is where life happens, where memories grow quietly in the background.

Vancouver is not just where I live. It is where I found a sense of belonging, where I have grown up and lived.  
No matter where I go in the world, this place will always echo inside me
